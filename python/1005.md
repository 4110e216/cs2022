strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.
a = "Hello, 錢德羅"
print(a[7])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
Strings are Arrays ==> acces the elemet of arrays
Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1
a = "Hello, Blue python"
print(a[4])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
Looping Through a String
for x in "Go Usti":
  print(x)
String Length:To get the length of a string, use the len()function.
a = "Hello, Blue Eagle!"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))
QUIZ:tell me how many char appear in "dshdsjadhsjahdsjhdecwej dsaksdjl"

a = "dshdsjadhsjahdsjhdecwej  dsaksdjl"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))
# 33 = 31 letter 2 space
Check String:To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in.
keyword in vs if
True or False
txt = "The best things in life are free!Gofor it "
# print("free" in txt) == > True
# print("Gofor" in txt) == > True
print("Gofo" in txt)  # False
txt = "The best things in life are free!Itrust you "
if "trust you" in txt:
  print ("trust you, 'free' is present.")

``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!Itrust you "
if "trust you" in txt:
  print ("trust you, 'free' is present.")

``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!HDJSAdhjs  dhsjahd32 dsaDJHSajdh "
if "HJSAdhj" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'HJSAdhj' is present.")
```
- Negative Indexing
``` python
b = "Hello, 錢德羅 !"
print(b[-5:-2])
# -2 not included
```
- Python - Modify Strings
- The `upper()` method returns the string in upper case:
- The lower() method returns the string in lower case
``` python
b = "Hello, Blue python!"
print(b.upper())
```
- Remove Whitespace with `strip()` method
- The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end
``` python
b = " Hello, Blu Eagle! "
print(b.strip())
```
- The `replace()`method replaces a string with another string
- `seperator`
``` python
b = " Hello, Blue python! "
print(b.replace("o", "w"))
```

```python
b = " Hello, Blue python "
print(b.split(","))
```

```python
b = " Hello, Blue python! "
print(b.split("B"))
```

- String Concatenation:To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the `+` operator.
```python
a = "Hello"
b = " , "
c = "錢德羅"
d = a + b + c
print(d)

```

- Python - Format - Strings
```python
age = 19
txt = "My name is 錢德羅 , and I am {}"
print(txt.format(19))


```


```python
quantity = 6
itemno = 400
price = 50.90
myorder = "I want {2} pieces of item {0} for {1} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))
```
- String Methods

```python
txt = "hello, and welcome to my world."

x = txt.capitalize()

print (x)
```


```python
txt = "Hello, And Welcome To My World!"

x = txt.casefold()

print(x)
